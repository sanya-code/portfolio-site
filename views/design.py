It all began back in sixth grade, when I first stumbled into the glittery chaos of Instagram. As a curious kid with a knack for obsession, I dove headfirst into the One Direction fandom (no regrets). That’s where I discovered an entire underground world of Photoshop edits, aesthetic fan-art, and beautifully designed covers — all for fanfictions. Yes, fanfictions. I was stunned. People were designing like it was Vogue… for a story about Harry Styles running a coffee shop.

Naturally, I wanted in.

Soon, I was spending an unhealthy amount of time on apps like PicsArt, Dafont, Phonto, Ibis Paint, and Snow. One thing led to another (and another), and now I’ve graduated to Figma — like a proper adult. What started as making story covers for fanfics-I-won’t-name evolved into something more meaningful: posters for college events, UI mockups, book club graphics, and design work for other student communities.

Along the way, I picked up color theory, typography, layout balance — and a mild addiction to aesthetic Pinterest boards. What was once a hobby became a side hustle and a creative escape that I still carry with me today.
